## The Valid Subsequence Problem
### Problem
Given two non-empty arrays of integers, write a function that determines whether the second array is a subsequence of the first one.
in other words, the function should check if the numbers in the second array appear somewhere in the first array, without their order changing.

### Example:

```text
array = [5, 1, 22, 25, 6, -1, 8, 10]
sequence = [1, 6, -1, 10]
should return true
```
